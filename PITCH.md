## Strategy for Effective Narration: Avoiding Overload

A critical aspect of our solution is ensuring the audio feedback is **useful, not overwhelming**. This requires intelligent design and user-centric control.

### Narration Strategies:

* **Trigger-Based Output:** Narration is not continuous. It's activated on-demand by the user via:
    * **Voice Commands:** E.g., "Quick scan," "What's in front of me?"
    * **Physical Tap Triggers:** E.g., a button on the earpiece or an integrated haptic sensor.
* **Summarize Over Describe:** Information is delivered concisely in a bullet-point or brief phrase format rather than verbose sentences.
    * **Example:** "3 people left, counter ahead." (Instead of "There are three people to your left, and there is a counter straight ahead.")
* **Confidence / Relevance Tags:** The system will only narrate objects or actions above a defined confidence threshold, reducing irrelevant noise. Contextual relevance will also be prioritized.
* **User Control & Customization:**
    * **Follow-up Queries:** Users can ask for more detail after an initial scan (e.g., "Where is the dog?", "Read that sign.").
    * **Adaptive Verbosity:** Users can set their preferred level of detail – from concise "pro" cues to more descriptive narration for "novices."
* **Audio Modality Choice:**
    * **Bone-Conduction Earphones:** Crucial for allowing one ear to remain free for natural ambient sounds (traffic, voices, cane taps).
    * **Non-Speech Cues:** Optional use of subtle pings or tones for proximity warnings (e.g., a low tone when nearing a wall).
